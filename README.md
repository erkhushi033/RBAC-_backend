👋 Hey there! Welcome to the RBAC System repository. This project is all about implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with modern web technologies. If you're into building secure systems with user authentication, role-based permissions, and solid authorization mechanisms, you're in the right place! 🚀

🎯 What’s This Project About?
Great question! Here's a quick overview:

Authentication: Users can securely register, log in, and log out.
Authorization: Access is controlled based on user roles (like Admin, User, and Moderator).
RBAC Integration: Dynamic role-based permissions restrict access to sensitive resources.
Security First: Password hashing, token-based sessions, and restricted routes to keep things safe.
🛠️ Built With
Here are the tools and technologies we used to make this magic happen:

Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose).
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Environment Management: dotenv.
📦 Installation Guide
